# Final-Project_Movie-Database


The movie dataset I am using contains 5000 movies catalogued by The Movie Database (TMDb). For this project, I will use this dataset to determine whether any information (budget, rating, actors/actresses, genre, etc.) about a movie can predict the total revenue of a movie. 

##I will also attempt to predict whether a movie's revenue will exceed its budget

I chose this topic because I have a love of movies and I would like to see if I can develop a model about something I care so much about.
